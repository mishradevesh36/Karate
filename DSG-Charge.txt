SonarQube
Benefit (JUnit): 
1. Increase productivity/stability in code.
2. Coding standard keep maintained as per TDD approach.

Benefit (Bugs, Codesmell, Vulnerability, Code duplicates & Code refractoring): 
1. Reduce maintanance time
2. Performance increased
3. Deliver bug free code
4. Codebase(.jar) size reduced

JUNit:-

1. It should be written for each (+/-)ve scenario, which help to build confidence in code. And if new dev start working in the existing method/class first time, they would get quick alert for any failure occurrence, Once.

2. It would be 1st time effort to write JUnit, and later on it will reduce development effort while tracing all error/bugs possibility while develpment. So due to this way, we can deliver also bug free code in one go. 


Code Smell
1. If code written on bad pattern. So the chance for occurring error/exception would be more on later.
(i.e. RuntimeException, try with resources is better to use, unused method etc.)

Bugs(Base on severity)
 Blocker(Highly Impact on production system):- Ex. Closing connection for jdbc/file IO stream . So it need to be fixed before deploying on production.
 Critical(Not much but it will impact on prod system):- SQL injection  
 Major(Not impact on prod system but it will impact on productivity of the developer):- ex. like unused multiple variables.
 
Minor:- Formatting code & not used too much code in a single block of method, declaring variable name should be follow standard naming conventions.

Code Duplicates:-
1. Redundant code is unecessary making huge line of code block & file size. And also it cause be more chance of bugs coming. So it will create difficulty in maintanance.

Query for orderfulfillment operation monitoring :
index=cloudfoundry (cf_org_name = "DSG-CHARGE") (cf_space_name="springboot_prod")  Service_Status="*" cf_app_name="orderfulfillment-rsp*"  NOT "getOrderStatus"| table  cf_app_name,Operation_Name ,Error_Details,Service_Status,Backend_Name,Message_Code,Message_Description,GUID

Query for submit order monitoring :
index=cloudfoundry (cf_org_name = "DSG-CHARGE") (cf_space_name="springboot_prod")  Service_Status="*" cf_app_name="orderfulfillment-rsp*"   "submitOrder"| table  cf_app_name,Operation_Name ,Error_Details,Service_Status,Backend_Name,Message_Code,Message_Description,GUID

Query for asyncNotifyServiceChangeResultRequest
index=cloudfoundry  <SAMSONORDERID>"asyncNotifyServiceChangeResultRequest"  NOT "Health check call from HAProxy"

Query for SAP orderID :
index=cloudfoundry  "<transactionIdValue>" "shipmentInfoUpdateRequest"
 
Steps to check the order flow :
•	Take the GUID from submit order monitoring query.
•	Search with GUID , we will get the Submit Order flow copy the UniversalOrderId from the ordercreateResponse.
•	Use this query to get all the processorder for that UniversalOrderId :
index=cloudfoundry  "processOrderRequest" "<UniversalOrderId >" cf_app_name=orderfulfillment-rsp
•	Take the GUID's and search one by one
•	we can find the InstallmentPlanID and <orderId>25243989</orderId> in createVarActivationOrderOutput tuxedo response.
•	we can find the sap client OrderId in  esiProcessOrderRequest element is <transactionId>
•	Note:
•	in one GUID flow we can find the InstallmentPlanID and samsonOrderId
•	in other GUID flow we can find the SAP client Order id
•	Copy the transactionId value and use the Query for SAP orderID  to get sap orderId
•	  get the value from <salesOrderNumber> element.
 

Capture the universalOrderId,samsonorderid ,sapclientorderid ,installmentID and sapOrdernumber in excel sheet , I have captured for few orders please take a look .

Fifth AWS Solutions Architect - Associate Challenge Has Passed

Your ApiServer is inside an AWS VPC named ApiVPC. There is another server named PeerServer, which is hosted in a VPC named PeerVPC. These two VPCs are connected using AWS VPC Peering. These two servers need to be able to communicate with each other, over private DNS, using all ports. However, when one of your coworkers attempts to communicate with the PeerServer from within the ApiServer, he is receiving timeout errors. Find out why and fix the issue. Ensure that any other servers that may be launched inside the same subnet as the ApiServer have the same level of access as the ApiServer.

Rather than individual, representative role has to be made visible

Topic to Closure
Any topic which is initiated, should go to closure, like Karate - ??

Cultural Change
Technical Code quality topic to be taken to further discussions and show some percenatage of improvement every sprint - Working

Project the good work
Visibility in terms of benefits of User Stories we work - ??

Customer Topics
We should look beyond Charge and DFM and see what other opportunities we have contribute to DSG space
May be a new API or an application that will make it more efficient. - Working JWT Client

Customer Topics
Repetitive issues with partners such as Inseego/TFB etc – Optimization is a part of our daily job.
But additionally we may come up with a solution specifically for them to make their dealings easier with TMO.
This in turn may contribute to TMO revenue - ??

Customer Topics
Operational Efficiency – Automation Enforced and measured – This I believe is already on the radar where we have the numbers but the leaders are still not seeing it in action. May be a NPE health Dashboard will help with more visibility to it.

Customer Topics
Tools to transition to – Springboot, Apache Camel or likes
Time and cost efficient conversion tool so that it is not another 1-2 year project for entire DSG
Opportunities to build smaller services (micro services) without impacting the customer experience- apparently DSG group may not want to bear the cost of changes the clients have to go through for our innovations

Customer Topics
Any cost effective feature to make our apps platform agnostic – This is already a work in progress with PKS initiative. It is worth exploring something that they haven’t done. Right now we are just dropping apps to PKS with no road map to production.
 So I am inclined to believe that there are challenges with effectiveness in moving to containerized apps if they are not really looking at true cloud infrastructure.

Customer Topics
a) Hygeia dashboard was being built internally in TMO to report out data from different sources like Gitlab where numbers of code check-ins, Deployments (Pass/fail rate), Code quality scans, Automation success rates etc could be measured. But
 not sure what state that is and if that is usable yet
b) Similar reports could be built for operational efficiency as well – sprint reports, Defects, Utilization and other KPIs that are not “out of box” from Jira or may not be consolidated in a view that makes more sense to leadership. Again this is something
 for the group not a DFM or Charge dashboard

Pristine Topics
Right now, we are working in bits and pieces, Billing and Presentation team has already done most part of it. There should be some one from DFM/CHARGE who can be a SPOC

Follow the below comment:

1. I am not satisfied with my appraisal this year, as I got just < 3% salary hike first time while spending 1.8 year in Capgemini, and last year I got 0 %. 
2. I don't think, here my skill/certification/knowledge got evaluated properly for my growth.
3.  H1-B also one reason, as I approached many time but didn't get success response for this year, It seems onsite opportunity is not possible here.
